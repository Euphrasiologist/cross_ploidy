    <h2>Number of cross ploidy hybrids by plant family, in a phylogenetic context (British flora)</h2>
    <p>
        The distribution of cross ploidy hybrids across the British flora. The phylogenetic tree is drawn from the
        Barcode UK dataset, with species randomly sampled within family to represent the tips. 97 families of flowering
        plant are shown, along with three coniferous families. The bars show the number of hybrids formed per family,
        with the light portion of the bar representing hybrids formed from parental species with the same ploidy, whilst
        the dark portion of the bar represents hybrids formed from parental species with different ploidy levels. Faded
        family names indicate missing ploidy data, and red family names highlight those families which contain five or
        more different ploidy levels (considering both between and within species variation). Bracketed numbers are the
        number of cross ploidy hybrids formed per family.

    <h2>Crossing diagrams in cross ploidy hybridisation</h2>

    <p>Cross ploidy (interploidy, or heteroploid) hybridisation, is a phenomenon where two individuals of different
        ploidy level hybridise. Ploidy level refers to the number of copies of the chromosome complement in every cell
        in an organism. Cross ploidy hybridisation, if it can form a hybrid, has diverse consequences for related
        lineages.</p>

    <p>These graphs hopefully show that:
    <ul>
        <li>Parental contributions to endosperm change in reciprocal crosses</li>
        <li>This means that crosses where the higher ploidy is the female parent are more likely</li>
        <li>Unreduced gametes can produce a tetraploid F1 hybrid in a single generation</li>
        <li>Triploids can backcross to produce diploid or tetraploid F2's. Tetraploid F2 formation is probably favoured
            because both parents can contribute to the formation of a tetraploid</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Business as usual</h3>
    <p>Here we have the situation where both male and female parents are diploid, so directionality of the hybridisation
        does not matter. Each parent produces haploid (洧논) gametes. The female parent contributes a diploid (2洧논,
        unreduced) genome to the endosperm (bold box) and the male parent contributes a haploid genome. The hybrid
        resulting from this cross is a first generation diploid (2洧논) hybrid. Usually viable.</p>

    <h3>Diploid-tetraploid hybridisation (reduced 洧논)</h3>
    <p>In this second scenario, a tetraploid female hybridises with a diploid male plant. Normal, unreduced gametes are
        formed. In this case, a triploid hybrid is hypothetically formed (left box). Due to the imbalance in the genomic
        contribution of the parents to the endosperm (4 parts female, 1 part male), a phenomenon known as 'triploid
        block' might occur. Sometimes viable.</p>

    <h3>Diploid-tetraploid hybridisation (reduced 洧논) second scendario</h3>
    <p>Although a triploid F1 is still
        hypothetically formed, the endosperm contribution from the parents is of a very different ratio and ploidy
        level. Inviable.</p>

    <h3>Diploid-tetraploid hybridisation (unreduced 洧논)</h3>
    <p>The first scenario in a diploid-tetraploid cross where the diploid parent produces unreduced (2洧논) gametes
        instead of the normal haploid (洧논) gametes. The hybrid which is formed is a tetraploid formed in a single
        generation. This cross is of importance firstly because in one step, the fertility of a tetraploid F1 hybrid is
        much higher than that of a triploid F1 hybrid. Secondly, the endosperm ratio has been restored, allowing for
        normal endosperm development. Viable F1.</p>

    <h3>Diploid-tetraploid hybridisation (unreduced 洧논) second scenario</h3>
    <p>Here, the female produced normal reduced gametes while the
        male pollen produced unreduced tetraploid gametes. This results in a pentaploid hybrid, with endosperm
        imbalance. Probably inviable?</p>

    <h3>Backcross to triploid (scenario 1)</h3>
    <p>There are multiple possibilities at this stage. One possibility is that the triploid (3洧논) F1 hybrid will
        backcross with the diploid progenitor. This will create a diploid F1 backcross hybrid.</p>
